# Credit Card Fraud Analysis

Project Team: 
Vikram Borra, Larry Pavlik, Austin Cappetta, Justin Sansbury, Gabriel Jean-jumeau

## Summary
Our team, operating under the name FraudBusters, aims to conduct a comprehensive analysis and prediction of various types of fraudulent activities within a large-scale dataset of 10 million bank transaction records. By leveraging advanced data analytics and machine learning techniques, we seek to identify patterns and trends that characterize different fraud types within the database. Our objective is to categorize these fraud instances, develop predictive models for forecasting future fraudulent behavior, and continuously refine our approach for all four distinct categories of fraud present in the dataset. Through this process, we aim to provide actionable insights and enhance the detection and prevention of fraud in banking systems
